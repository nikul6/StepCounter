# StepCounter - using Expo, TypeScript and React Native Health

The Stepcounter app, built using Expo and React Native, tracks health metrics like Steps, Distance, and Flights Climbed. It employs "react-native-svg" for visualizing progress rings and "react-native-reanimated" for smooth animations. The "react-native-health" library gathers data, while date-wise tracking helps users monitor their health journey effectively.
